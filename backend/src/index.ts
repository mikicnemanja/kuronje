// Simplified Ponder indexer setup
// This file will contain the event handlers once the Ponder API is properly configured

// For now, this is a placeholder file
// The actual event handling will be implemented once:
// 1. The contract is deployed and address is updated in ponder.config.ts
// 2. The correct Ponder API syntax is confirmed
// 3. The database schema is finalized

// Event handlers will be added here following the correct Ponder patterns:
// - Handle Transfer events for mints and transfers
// - Handle Approval events
// - Update database records for tokens, owners, and collection stats

console.log("📝 Ponder indexer configuration placeholder loaded");
console.log(
  "✅ Update this file with actual event handlers once contract is deployed"
);
